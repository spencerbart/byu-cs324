1. socket and connect
2. You could use the sendto() or sendmsg() function to send messages via UDP
3. The strings written to the socket come from the write() command
4. All ports are the same when running the client once
5. It uses a different port for each socket when hitting it multiple times
6. One socket was used for all clients
7. There was 3 total calls to the write() function on the client
8. All 3 messages were received by the kernal
9. 3 calls to recvfrom() were called to process all the messages
10. recvfrom can only read in one packet. When the packet is smaller than the passed buffer, only that much data is returned.
11. The second socket that is generated by accept is being used and not in a passive state listening for new requests.
12. UDP connection simply sends the data and doesn't care if the data actually got there. TCP on the other hand actaully establishes a connection where it confirms whether or not the recepient got the data.
13. TCP connections establish a connection between the client and the server so that they can verify receipt after send. It moves the connection to a new port so that it can wait for messages to be sent.
14. Messages sent using the same socket use the same port
15. Multiple messages being sent use different ports
16. Multiple sockets can be used to receive requests. This is different that UDP because TCP moves the connection to a new socket.
17. 3 write calls were made by the client
18. 3 messages were received by the server
19. There was only 1 call to recv() and it read all 15 bytes.
20. TCP does not preserve record boundaries.

1. Be still, my soul: The Lord is on thy side;
With patience bear thy cross of grief or pain.
Leave to thy God to order and provide;
In ev'ry change he faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul: Thy best, thy heav'nly Friend
Thru thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

2. Be still, my soul: Thy God doth undertake
To guide the future as he has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul: The waves and winds still know
His voice who ruled them while he dwelt below.

3. Be still, my soul: The hour is hast'ning on
When we shall be forever with the Lord,
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul: When change and tears are past,
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.

26. If no messages are available at the socket, the receive calls wait for a message to arrive, unless the socket is nonblocking (see fcntl(2)), in which case the value -1 is returned
27. It is not an error if the number of bytes read was fewer than the amount requested. It can haple for a couple of reasons such as fewer bytes are available right now.
28. When the packet is smaller than the passed buffer, only that much data is returned
